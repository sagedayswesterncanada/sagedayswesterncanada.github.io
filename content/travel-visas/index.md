# Visa and immigration requirements

All international participants are welcome. It is the responsibility of all
participants to check visa requirements for Canada and obtain the correct visa.
See [this
page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/business/visitors-events-conferences.html)
for help.

We also mention that that [travellers to the United States clear US Customs at
the Calgary airport
(YYC)](https://www.yyc.com/en-us/flights/customs-immigration) rather than the
ﬁrst destination airport in the US.
