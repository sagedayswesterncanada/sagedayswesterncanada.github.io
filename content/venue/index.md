## Accessing Barrier Lake Station

The closest airport is [Calgary International Airport (YYC)](https://www.yyc.com/en-us/).
The venue is less than 1h30 away by car from the Calgary airport.

We will organize ground transportation from the University of Calgary to the
venue on the afternoon (Sunday June 7th) before the workshop starts (Monday
June 8th). Therefore, participants are encouraged to stay a total of five
nights at Barrier Lake Station.

The University of Calgary is easily accessibly by public transit. Participants
are responsible for arriving at the meet-up point in Calgary on time on their
own.

Depending on the flight times available to you and how far you are travelling
from (and your likelihood of flight delays), you may wish to arrive in Calgary
the night before and stay at a hotel at your own expense. There are several
hotels in Calgary near the Banff Trail CTrain LRT station, which is only one
stop away from the University of Calgary station.

## Cost

We estimate that the cost of attending will be between $500 and $600 CAD.
We will update this website with more precise information as soon as we have it.
This includes both accommodations and meals for the duration of the workshop.

# Child care

We are applying for funds to help cover child care costs for participants with
children. Depending on the age of your children and venue space, this could
mean offering reimbursements to offset childcare costs, or having your children
and a caregiver stay at Barrier Lake.

As we have not received a decision on all funding applications yet, we cannot
make any promises about childcare yet. **If you are considering attending the
workshop and will require support with childcare, please contact us at
[sagedays.westerncan@ucalgary.ca](mailto:sagedays.westerncan@ucalgary.ca) as
soon as possible.**

# Alternative venues

Participants are welcome to look for alternative accommodation nearby, at their
own cost. Please note that if you do so, **you will need a car**, as there are
no public transportation options to Barrier Lake in the area. The workshop
registration fees are just to cover the costs of accommodations and meals at
Barrier Lake, so if you are staying at an alternative site then your
registration fee will be prorated to the cost of the meals you have at Barrier
Lake.

Here are some possible alternative venues:
- The closest and cheapest hotel is the [Stony Nakoda Resort &
Casino](https://www.stoneynakodaresort.com/), only 10 km from the Station.
Booking directly on their website is expensive, but third-part websites
(e.g. [Expedia](expedia.ca), [Hotels.com](hotels.com)) have lower rates.
- The next closest options are Kananaskis Village (18 km by car) and Canmore (39 km by car).

**This area is a popular tourist destination in the summer, so booking early is strongly recommended!**
