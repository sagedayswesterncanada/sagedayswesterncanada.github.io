# Funding

- Funding for accommodations and meals at Barrier Lake Station during the event is available for a limited number of students and postdocs.
    *We hope to be able to cover accommodations and meals for as many students and postdocs as possible, but cannot make guarantees until we have a final participant count.*
- Participants are expected to pay for their own travel.

See the estimated cost [here](/venue/#cost).

# How to apply

## Instructions

To participate, we ask that you submit an application. **We will soon put a

SageMath, or to both; at least one of those is necessary. 300 words maximum.

words maximum.

addressing the two above issues must be sent to the workshop email, by the

For organizational purposes, we will also ask questions about your level of
