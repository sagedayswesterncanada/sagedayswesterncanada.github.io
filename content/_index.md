# Goal of the event

Sage Days are events that have been organized by the Sage community [since
2005](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops). Their goals and activities vary
greatly. The goal of our event is threefold:

1. **Welcoming and integrating newcomers.** Sage Days is a fantastic
   opportunity for young researchers and complete beginners to get going with
Sage. If you know you need SageMath for your own research or want to contribute
to it, but don't know where to start, this event is perfect for you.

2. **Maintain and add new features to Sage.** Sage is built and maintained by
   volunteers publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/). We want
to facilitate this process by gathering developers in a room and allow them to
discuss new ideas, initiate new collaborations, and finish long-ongoing
projects with as little friction as possible.

3. **Gather the community to address governance and technical directions.**
   SageMath is a decentralized and international project; it is crucial for its
members to stay connected and united. We will discuss and reflect on how the
project is led and foster its community.

In other words, Sage Days should either be directly beneficial to you as a
scientist, or directly beneficial to SageMath itself (see Registration).

## Dates

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Workshop start | Monday June 8th 2026, morning |
| Workshop end | Friday June 12th 2026, after lunch |

We encourage participants who travel through Calgary airport (YCC) to arrive at
Calgary Airport on Sunday June 7th, as we will provide ground transportation
from Calgary to the venue (see
[here](/venue/#accessing-barrier-lake-station)).

## Requirements

All are welcome, including complete beginners (no programming experience is
required). We will have sessions on installing SageMath, the basics of
SageMath, the basics of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/), etc; more in
[Activities](/activities). The requirements are:

- A laptop (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Be willing to learn, help and participate!

The venue has Eduroam, and we will provide power bars.

## Codes of conduct

SageMath is an international, decentralized, free and open source project. Its
future can only be viable if it is supported by a unified community, a safe
space in which members are welcome to express new ideas.

**We will strongly emphasize those aspects.** Participants at *Sage Days
Western Canada* are expected to adhere to all the policies described at these
links. Violations may result in dismissal from the workshop.

Our code of conduct is the union of three codes of conduct: the [SageMath code
of conduct](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
the [University of Calgary code of
conduct](https://www.ucalgary.ca/hr/work-compensation/working-ucalgary/code-conduct),
and the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) code of
conduct](https://web.pims.math.ca/about/policies-statements/code-conduct).
